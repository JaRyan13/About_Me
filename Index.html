        When I was two I was brought to the United States. When I was age of seven I got my first computer. This is when I knew I loved computers and how they worked. This is also when I got into gaming. As games grew I realized I needed a stronger computer. It took many trial and errors and money to figure out how all the components of a pc worked. At this point I have built my own pc from the ground up and i was proud of it. All the coding I knew or I thought I knew was all self taught and very basic. With this limited knownledge of HTML, Python, and Java I was able to build very basic bots and websites. Rarely they would ever run or work. With the frustation and pride of coding my own programs/ websites I knew I needed to expand my knownledge so here I am taking Web Develpoment 100.
